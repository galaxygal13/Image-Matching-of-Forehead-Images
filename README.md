# Image-Matching-of-Forehead-Images
Performed Image matching on forehead images using popular feature extracting algorithms like SIFT (Scale-invariant feature 
transform) SURF (Speeded Up Robust Features) and ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF). After that I calculated CRR, FAR, 
FRR, EER, accuracy, threshold and prepared a genuine/imposter histogram for all the three algorithms. The scores were 
calculated using Lowe's ratio test.
